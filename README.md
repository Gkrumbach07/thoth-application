# thoth-application

This repository is a test to play around with the proposed solution of representing deployment target environments
as git branches.

This proposal has two main aspects:

1. separate responsibilities and possibilities of Dev/DevOps and SRE/Ops team
2. give a single view on one deployment target environment at a time

## Separation of Application Components and Application Configuration


## Use Cases

### testing a pull request

### pushing a release to production

### developing a new component
